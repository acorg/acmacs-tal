* Tree
** Import
*** DONE Newick
*** SOMETHING json
** Export
*** DONE Newick
- omit hidden subtrees
*** SOMETHING json
**** DONE sequences
**** DONE dates
**** DONE continent, country
**** DONE hi names
**** clades
**** aa substs
**** hz lines
*** text
*** SOMETHING html
*** isig: data.csv and tree.newick for https://github.com/acorg/isig
** Processing
*** DONE Obtain sequences and hi-names from seqdb
*** Obtain sequences from fasta
*** DONE Infer subtype, lineage
*** DONE Cumulative edge length
*** Infer long branch subtrees
*** DONE Ladderize
*** DONE Re-root
*** DONE Continents and countries
*** DONE Stat by month for time series
*** SOMETHING Infer AA subst for subrees ("to" part of AA)
*** SOMETHING Infer "from" part of AA subst --> aa-transition.hh
*** DONE Infer clades
- regular clades
  - remove small clades
- H1 183P subclades
- B/Vic 2del and 3del
*** Infer vaccines
please use the earliest cell based isolate from a cc.  as when
looking in trees we are looking at what eveolved from what, and how
the evolution might have gone, and do not care about egg adaptions.
*** Infer hz sections
- infer all as substitute for section
- AA subst for a section (to be shown in the map title)
- hide/show sections
*** Hide subtrees and leaves
**** DONE hide if cumulative edge length bigger than
**** DONE hide isolated before
**** DONE hide by seq_id and regexp
**** DONE hide by aa
**** hide between
**** hide not found in chart
*** AAAtPosDraw
- find_most_diverse_positions
- infer sections: make_aa_pos_sections
*** Match antigens from chart
- tracked antigens for each section
- tracked sera for each section
  - egg/cell/reasortant matched
  - all matched by antigen name without passage
  - infer all as substitute for a panel, find all sequenced ags in chart that have those aa substitutions and find all Sera in chart with names of those antigens and draw circles


* Draw
** Read from json and draw
** Layout
- Aspect ratio, resolution
  - tree 565 x 800
  - sig page 1360 x 850

  - Lines and circles attached to strain or clade positions
- Legend with continent and optional colored continent names
  Colors of continents may vary (slightly)
- Title: subtype, chart lab and assay
- Time series
- Isolation month coloring bar
- Markers: colored dashes
  - B/Vic 2del and 3del mutants
  - H1 183P subclades
- Names of subclades or hz sections (e.g. H1 183P subclades)
- Clades
- AA at pos
- Antigens from chart
- Maps
- Text anywhere
** Tree
- coloring
  - continent
    - make some colors darker to make labels more readable
  - clade
  - aa at pos
  - all of the same color

** Dashes for mapped antigens and section border
- MappedAntigensDraw
** Clades
- slots
- label and label position, rotated label
- left and right orientation (to the left/right of time series)
